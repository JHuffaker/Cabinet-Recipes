# Cabinet Recipes

The purpose of this application is to continue to increase my skills in Swift and SwiftUI, and to learn to how to create and apply a Firestore database.

The app displays a list of recipes that the user has created. It gives the user the option to look at the recipes, edit them, delete them, and add additional recipes.

# Cloud Database

For my database, I decided to use Firestore, part of Google Firebase. The database is structured into documents. Each document can holds maps of data types, and can even contain their own subcollections. The database is navigated by referring to the collection and folders the user would like to have access to.

# Development Environment

* Give different levels of access depending upon the user.
* Improve the UI and design.
